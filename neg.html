  objected to a violent video game in his home. After finding the game, his father would place<br>
  it in a lockbox, along with a handgun. Daniel, after a month of not being able to play this<br>
  game, had enough and snapped into a fit of rage.

  Grabbing his father's handgun, Daniel Petric told his parents to close their eyes and he began shooting.<br>
  Daniel's mother would die almost instantly, while the father, shot in the head, would go on to survive the attack.<br>
  The only saving grace in this vicious shooting was that Daniel's sister showing up at the home.<br>
  Almost immediately after the shooting had occurred, his sister showed up at the front door and called for the paramedics.<br>
  Daniel would give up his gun and flee the scene, later being caught by local law enforcement. <br>
  After the shooting incident and Daniel's arrest, the father and son are currently still speaking to each other.
